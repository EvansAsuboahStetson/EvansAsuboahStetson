About ME

Growing up, I frequently moved between cocoa farms, witnessing firsthand the interplay of nature and agriculture. This upbringing instilled in me a profound appreciation for the land and the hardworking people who cultivate it. My brother, who became a quality control officer in the cocoa industry, further cemented my connection to this vital sector. However, my journey diverged when I chose computer science as my career path. This decision wasn't a departure from my roots but an expansion of my horizon, aiming to integrate diverse knowledge streams to address challenges in my homeland.

My pursuit of computer science was filled with its own set of challenges. Attending a small Predominantly White Institution (PWI) in Florida, I found myself in an environment where opportunities weren't readily available, especially for someone with my background. The contrast between my rural upbringing and the academic setting was stark. Resources were limited, and the support network was not as robust as in larger, more diverse universities. This disparity meant that I had to forge my path, relentlessly seeking opportunities where none seemed to exist.

This determination led me to secure prestigious internships at Workday and Amazon, achievements that seemed distant dreams when I first started my journey. These experiences were not just milestones in my professional development; they were testaments to my perseverance and adaptability. At Workday and Amazon, I honed my skills in software development and gained insights into how technology could be leveraged to solve real-world problems.

Now, as I look to the future, I see limitless possibilities. I am driven to use my expertise in software development to make a tangible difference in the cocoa industry , an industry that is so integral to my identity and my homeland. By combining my background in agriculture with my technical skills, I aim to develop solutions that enhance agricultural practices, improve supply chain transparency, and empower cocoa farmers.

My journey from the cocoa farms to computer labs, from a small PWI in Florida to prestigious tech internships, is a testament to my resilience and dedication. It's a journey that reflects not just my personal growth, but also my commitment to using my talents for the greater good, especially in communities similar to where my story began. The sky is indeed the limit, and I am eager to reach for it, grounded in my roots and propelled by my passion for technology and innovation.
